# DocConvo

This project consists of two Streamlit applications for document-related queries and for visualizing data in Excel files. The applications are designed to provide a seamless experience for users interested in interacting with their documents and visualizing  data.


# Features

## Document Chat

- PDF Processing: Users can upload PDF documents, and the system extracts text for further analysis.
- Conversational AI: Utilizes a Conversational Retrieval Chain for handling user queries and generating responses based on document content.
- Word Cloud Visualization: Generates and displays a word cloud based on the processed document text.

## Excel Plotter
- Excel File Upload: Users can upload Excel files (.xlsx or .csv) for data analysis and visualization.
- Column Selection: Allows users to select specific columns for analysis.
- Grouping and Plotting: Group and visualize data based on selected columns, with support for bar plots.
- Download Options: Provides download links for the processed Excel file and generated plots.
